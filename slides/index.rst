Summary
=======

 * in the beginning
 * being digital
 * touching the sky
 * back on earth
 * sniffing the stacktrace
 * being real

In the beginning
================

  In the beginning was the abacus...

Technology started on real things you could touch


Being digital
=============

.. from the predominance of HW to that of SW

From Big-Blue to Micro-Soft



Touching the Sky
================

.. insert nice icons...

Alice in Metaphorsland: desktops, trash-bins and wizards


Leaving Earth
=============

Abstraction can be addictive


Sniffing the stacktrace
=======================

.. insert a nice fire image, an exploding component would also fit


Being real
==========

Physical computing:
low cost MCU's and electronic components


Back to the origins
===================

Splitting the bytes


Here comes the King
===================

Arduino's revolution


What's inside?
==============

 * device
 * bootloader
 * libraries
 * IDE
 * community

.. expose single points
 
 
King's audience
===============

How to talk with Arduino?

 * serial
 * sensors
 * RF
 * ethernet
 
 
Firmata protocol
================

.. less chatty
 
 
Snake's attack
==============

 * ASCII messages
 * compact protocols

ASCII snake
===========

.. ASCII example


Firmata snake
=============

pyfirmata to the rescue

.. firmata example
